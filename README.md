# Juiced

A statically typed programming language with a compiler that targets WebAssembly as a backend and allows a TypeScript application to import the compiled output as an ES module.

## Motivation
The project was developed to gain a better understanding of WebAssembly and learn the inner workings of a compiler.

## Notes
1. The feature set of the language is limited as this was an experiment and was only worked on part time for a month (October 2021).
2. There are a lot of things to improve on but I still think this is a cool project worth of displaying.
